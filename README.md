# wheelchair-eyetracker
These are the project files for a wheelchair that is controlled by eye movements. Tracking is done by a modified webcam and a Raspberri Pi 2B along with an Arduino to control the motors. I developed this with a fellow student for the German Science Competition (Jugend forscht) and it won first prize :-)
